## Migration from auth-broker

As of `pydantic-openapi-generator` version `2.2.8`, this package has moved out
of the `auth-broker` organisation, been renamed, and had its import namespace
updated.

| Item | Previous | Current |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub repository | [`auth-broker/openapi-python-generator`](https://github.com/auth-broker/openapi-python-generator) | [`mattcoulter7/pydantic-openapi-generator`](https://github.com/mattcoulter7/pydantic-openapi-generator) |
| PyPI package | [`ab-openapi-python-generator`](https://pypi.org/project/ab-openapi-python-generator/) | [`pydantic-openapi-generator`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-openapi-generator/) |
| CLI command | `ab-openapi-python-generator` | `pydantic-openapi-generator` |
| Import namespace | `ab_openapi_python_generator` | `pydantic_openapi_generator` |

The old PyPI package is retained as an archived historical package. New work
should use `pydantic-openapi-generator` and `pydantic_openapi_generator`.

## Features

- __Ease of use__. Provide input, output and the library, and the generator will do the rest.
- __Type safety and type hinting.__ __Pydantic OpenAPI Generator__ makes heavy use of pydantic models to provide type-safe data structures.
- __Support for multiple rest frameworks.__ __Pydantic OpenAPI Generator__ currently supports the following:
    - [httpx](https://pypi.org/project/httpx/)
    - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
    - [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/)
- __Async and sync code generation support__, depending on the framework. It will automatically create both for frameworks that support both.
- __Easily extendable using Jinja2 templates__. The code is designed to be easily extendable and should support even more languages and frameworks in the future.
- __Fully tested__. Every generated code is automatically tested against the OpenAPI spec and we have 100% coverage.
- __Usage as CLI or as library__.
